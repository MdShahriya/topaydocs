# Scholarly Interpretations & Rulings on Riba

Islamic scholars have discussed and debated the concept of riba (usury or interest) extensively, with differing views on its application in various financial transactions. Below are the key interpretations and rulings of prominent scholars regarding riba, including the differences in opinion on its application to sales and debts.

## 1. Ibn Abbas (RA) vs. Abu Said Al-Khudri (RA) – Difference in Opinion on Riba in Sales vs. Debts

> *Ibn Abbas (RA) and Abu Said Al-Khudri (RA) had differing views on whether riba applies only to debts or also to sales and exchanges.*

### 1.Explanation

- **Ibn Abbas (RA)**, a prominent companion and scholar, **interpreted riba** as applicable to both **debts** and **sales**, especially in transactions involving items like gold, silver, dates, and other **measured or weighed commodities**.
  - He believed that if there was an **unequal exchange** or if goods were exchanged in a **delayed transaction**, it would constitute riba, even in **sales**. For example, if one person gave gold for gold but in unequal amounts, or if there was a delay in payment, that transaction would be considered **riba**.
  - This view stems from his understanding of the Quranic verses and hadiths that mention riba, extending the prohibition to all forms of trade where there is **inequality or delay**.
- On the other hand, **Abu Said Al-Khudri (RA)**, another prominent companion, believed that riba primarily applied to **debts** (loans), not to regular sales or exchanges of goods.
  - He took a more **restrictive view**, maintaining that **riba in trade** (such as exchanging goods) would only apply if **money or commodities** were exchanged in unequal amounts or if there was **deferred payment**. However, if goods were exchanged fairly (equal amounts and immediate payment), it would not be considered riba.
  - Abu Said's view suggests a more **liberal interpretation**, where regular trade exchanges, provided there is no **delay** or **inequality**, do not fall under the prohibition of riba.
- This difference in opinion demonstrates that **riba** was understood and applied differently by early scholars, and it highlights the **nuances** in interpreting the texts regarding **transactions** and **commercial dealings**.
- **Key takeaway**: The difference in opinions between **Ibn Abbas** and **Abu Said** demonstrates that **riba** can be seen as both a **financial exploitation** in debt and trade, with scholars emphasizing **equal exchange** and **immediate payment** as key factors in avoiding riba.

## 2. Jumhoor (Majority Scholars) – Riba Applies to Unequal Exchanges of Gold, Silver, and Other Weighed/Measured Commodities

> *The majority of scholars (Jumhoor) agree that riba applies to any **unequal exchange** of gold, silver, and other weighed or measured commodities, even in trade.*

### 2.Explanation

- The **Jumhoor** (majority) of scholars, including those from the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali schools, hold that **riba** applies to exchanges of **gold**, **silver**, and other **measured or weighed commodities** where there is **inequality** in the amounts or if the exchange involves a **deferred payment**.
  - The **basis** for this ruling is rooted in the Quran and the hadiths, where the Prophet ﷺ specifically mentioned that riba occurs in transactions involving **like for like** (e.g., gold for gold, dates for dates). These transactions must meet the criteria of **equal amounts** and **immediate payment** to be valid.
  - If there is **any discrepancy** in the quantity or quality of the goods being exchanged, or if one of the parties is required to pay later (i.e., delayed payment), then the transaction would be considered riba and thus prohibited.
  - Scholars emphasize that riba is not restricted to **loans** or **debts** alone but extends to **trade** involving items that are **measured** or **weighed**, such as **gold**, **silver**, **wheat**, and **dates**. The prohibition is in place to prevent **exploitation** and ensure fairness in all financial dealings.
- This interpretation is consistent with the understanding that the **underlying principle** behind riba is the **exploitation** that occurs when one party is at a financial disadvantage due to **unequal transactions** or the **time value** of money.
- **Key takeaway**: The majority of scholars argue that **riba applies to all unequal exchanges**, not just in loans, but also in commercial transactions involving valuable commodities that are **measured** or **weighed**.

## 3. Al-Aini's Commentary – Explains Differing Scholarly Opinions, Highlighting that Most Scholars Prohibit All Forms of Riba

> *Al-Aini, a famous scholar, provided a detailed commentary on the differing scholarly opinions and clarified that most scholars prohibit all forms of riba, whether in **debts** or **sales**.*

### 3.Explanation

- **Al-Aini**, a prominent scholar of the Hanafi school, in his commentary on riba, emphasized the **uniform prohibition** of all forms of riba, regardless of whether it occurs in **loans** or **sales**.
  - He elaborates on the different scholarly views on riba, noting that while there were some **disagreements** among the early scholars regarding whether riba applies to **debts** only or extends to **sales**, the consensus among the majority of scholars is that **all forms of riba are prohibited**.
  - Al-Aini points out that while **Ibn Abbas (RA)** extended the prohibition of riba to certain types of **traded goods** (e.g., gold and silver), the consensus view is that riba encompasses both **usury** in lending and **unfair exchanges** in trade, which are both seen as exploitative practices.
  - He further clarifies that the prohibition of riba in **sales** is crucial to prevent financial **exploitation** and to ensure that transactions are **fair** and **just** for all parties involved.
  - Al-Aini's commentary thus reinforces the view that **riba is not limited to loans** but extends to any financial exchange that involves **inequality** or **unjust enrichment**.
- **Key takeaway**: Al-Aini's commentary confirms the **majority scholarly view** that all forms of riba are prohibited, including both **interest-based loans** and **unfair trade transactions** involving **measured commodities**.

## Conclusion

Scholarly interpretations on riba highlight the complexity of its application in different financial transactions. Key points include:

- **Ibn Abbas (RA)** extended the concept of riba to **sales**, emphasizing **unequal exchanges** in commodities like gold and silver.
- **Abu Said Al-Khudri (RA)** focused on riba as being primarily linked to **debts**, not sales, offering a more restricted view.
- The **Jumhoor (majority)** of scholars emphasize the prohibition of riba in all transactions involving **measured or weighed commodities**, especially when there is **inequality** or **deferred payment**.
- **Al-Aini** and other scholars highlight that the consensus among the majority is to prohibit all forms of riba, whether in **loans** or **sales**, to protect against **exploitation** and ensure **equity** in financial dealings.

These interpretations guide modern Islamic finance, advocating for **just and fair financial systems** free from exploitation and **interest-based transactions**.

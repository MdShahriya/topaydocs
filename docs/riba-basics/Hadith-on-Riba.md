## 2. Bukhari (2015), Muslim (89)

> *"Seven destructive sins: shirk, magic, unjust killing, consuming riba, consuming orphan’s wealth, fleeing from battle, and slandering chaste women."*

### 2.Explanation

- In this hadith, the Prophet ﷺ lists **seven destructive sins**, of which **consuming riba** is included. These sins are considered among the **gravest offenses** in Islam because they have far-reaching consequences for both the individual and society.
- **Shirk** (associating partners with Allah) and **magic** are included because they directly attack the **fundamental tenets of faith**. Similarly, **unjust killing** and **consuming orphan’s wealth** are destructive to human life and rights.
- The Prophet ﷺ specifically includes **riba** in this list, emphasizing that it is not just a financial issue but a **spiritual** and **moral** corruption that undermines the integrity of a believer’s faith and the well-being of the community.
- The inclusion of **riba** as one of the **seven destructive sins** elevates its severity, reminding Muslims that this is not a minor issue but a **major sin** that can lead to both **social unrest** and **spiritual decay**.
- **Key takeaway**: Consuming riba is a **grave sin**, and it is **placed alongside other major offenses** that directly harm both individuals and society.

## 3. Muslim (7597)

> *"The Prophet ﷺ cursed the one who consumes, gives, records, and witnesses riba transactions."*

### 3.Explanation

- This hadith highlights the **comprehensive nature** of the prohibition of riba in Islam. The Prophet ﷺ specifically curses not only the person who consumes riba but also the one who **gives** it, the one who **records** the transaction, and even the one who **witnesses** it.
- The inclusion of these different roles underlines the **shared responsibility** of all individuals involved in an interest-based transaction. It's not just the lender or borrower who is held accountable, but also anyone who facilitates or supports the transaction.
- The curse is a **severe warning** to those who engage in any part of the riba process, emphasizing that all participants, whether directly or indirectly involved, are equally guilty.
- This hadith reinforces the **moral obligation** of Muslims to avoid supporting or participating in any form of riba. It shows that **neutrality** is not an option; one must actively avoid and discourage such transactions.
- **Key takeaway**: The curse applies to everyone who plays any role in a riba transaction, including the lender, borrower, and those facilitating or witnessing the process.

## 4. Abu Said Al-Khudri & Ibn Abbas Debate

> *"Discussion on whether riba applies only to debts or also to exchanges."*

### 4.Explanation

- This hadith represents a **debate** between two prominent companions, **Abu Said Al-Khudri** and **Ibn Abbas**, about the scope of the prohibition of riba. The debate centers around whether riba is only applicable to **debts** or if it also extends to **exchanges** (such as trading goods or services).
- **Ibn Abbas** held the view that riba applies to both **debts** and **exchanges** (like exchanging items of the same type, such as gold for gold or dates for dates). He argued that riba in trade applies when there is a **delay** or **unequal exchange** in transactions.
- **Abu Said Al-Khudri**, on the other hand, argued that riba primarily applies to **loans and debts**, not trade. However, their discussion reveals a difference in **interpretation** of the Quranic prohibitions and hadiths.
- This debate highlights the **complexity** of the issue and underscores the need for scholars to carefully consider context and application in different situations. It also shows that **riba** is not always straightforward and requires deep understanding and deliberation.
- **Key takeaway**: The debate illustrates that riba’s prohibition can extend beyond **debt transactions** to certain forms of trade, depending on the **conditions** of the exchange, such as whether the exchange is fair or involves **unequal gain**.

- Riba leads to **spiritual decay**, and its consequences are both **eternal and severe**, affecting both the individual and society.
- The **debate** among scholars about the scope of riba highlights the need for careful consideration of the context, and it is a reminder that riba is not only an issue in loans but can also affect **trade and exchanges** under certain conditions.

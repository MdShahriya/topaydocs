# Quranic Verses on Riba

The practice of riba (usury or interest) has been a subject of significant ethical, economic, and religious debate across different cultures and societies. In the Islamic faith, riba is strictly prohibited due to its exploitative nature and the negative impact it can have on both individuals and society. The Quran, as the foundational text of Islam, contains several verses that provide warnings and guidelines concerning riba. While these verses come from a religious context, the underlying principles have relevance for individuals and societies beyond religious affiliations, especially in promoting economic justice and fairness.

## What are Surahs and Quranic Verses?

### **Surah**

- A **Surah** is a chapter in the Quran. The Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, is divided into **114 Surahs**. Each Surah varies in length and covers different aspects of life, ethics, spirituality, law, and guidance. The Surahs were revealed over 23 years, with some chapters being very short and others longer. The term **Surah** is derived from the Arabic word "Sura," meaning "a division or a chapter."

### **Quranic Verses**

- A **verse** in the Quran is known as an **Ayah** (plural: **Ayat**). Each Surah is made up of individual verses that vary in length. Quranic verses are considered to be the direct words of Allah, conveyed to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through the Angel Jibril (Gabriel). The verses offer guidance on all aspects of life, and they address everything from ethics and social behavior to laws and spiritual guidance. The Quran is often read and recited by Muslims in Arabic, as the verses are considered to be divinely preserved in their original language.

## 1. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:275)

> *"Those who consume riba will stand on the Day of Judgment like one beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, 'Trade is just like riba.' But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba. So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops, may keep what was before, and his case rests with Allah. But whoever returns to it, they are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein."*

### 1.Explanation

- This verse highlights the **severe consequences** for those who engage in riba (usury or interest). In Islamic belief, individuals who exploit others through interest-based transactions will face spiritual consequences. The Quran contrasts riba with **trade**, indicating that while trade is lawful and beneficial, riba is unjust and exploitative.
- The verse also offers a path for **repentance**. If a person abandons interest-based transactions, their past dealings are forgiven. However, those who persist in riba are warned of **eternal punishment**.
- From a broader perspective, this verse stresses the importance of **fairness** in financial transactions and emphasizes that financial systems should promote **equity** rather than exploitation.

## 2. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:276)

> *"Allah destroys riba and increases charity. And Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner."*

### 2.Explanation

- This verse points out the **negative long-term effects** of engaging in riba. While it may seem like riba brings financial gain, it leads to **moral decay** and **economic instability** in the long run.
- In contrast, **charity** (sadaqah) leads to **genuine prosperity**, not just in a material sense, but also in terms of **spiritual growth**. The verse suggests that sharing wealth with those in need fosters social cohesion and reduces inequality.
- This perspective aligns with many **global ethical frameworks** that emphasize the importance of **generosity** and **redistribution** for social well-being.

## 3. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:278-279)

> *"O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains due from riba, if you are believers. And if you do not, then be informed of war from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal—neither will you do wrong nor will you be wronged."*

### 3.Explanation

- This is a strong warning against the continuation of riba-based transactions. From an ethical standpoint, the verse emphasizes that financial dealings should be based on fairness and mutual respect, rather than exploitation.
- The concept of **repentance** and **rectifying past wrongs** is central here. Individuals are encouraged to return to ethical practices, where the **lender receives only their original loan**—without exploiting the borrower with interest.
- From a **social justice** perspective, the message here advocates for **economic equality**, where both parties in a transaction are treated fairly, and wealth does not accumulate at the expense of others.

## 4. Surah Aal-e-Imran (3:130)

> *"O believers, do not consume riba, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah so that you may be successful."*

### 4.Explanation

- This verse specifically condemns the practice of **compounded interest**, which can cause debts to spiral out of control. The interest grows exponentially over time, leading to **financial hardship** for the borrower.
- It is a call to **ethical financial conduct**, urging individuals to act in ways that benefit society as a whole. While it specifically addresses the believers, the principle of **avoiding exploitative financial practices** is universal and applicable to all people, regardless of their religious beliefs.
- The message is clear: **Financial systems** should encourage fairness and transparency, not lead to the accumulation of wealth at the cost of others' suffering.

## 5. Surah An-Nisa (4:161)

> *"And for their taking of riba, although they were forbidden from it, and their consuming of people’s wealth unjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment."*

### 5.Explanation

- This verse reflects on the **historical context** where riba was also forbidden for previous religious communities, such as Jews and Christians. It points out that despite the prohibition, some individuals still participated in interest-based transactions, causing injustice and inequality.
- The verse stresses that riba leads to the **unjust consumption of wealth**, and those who engage in it are seen as contributing to **economic injustice** and **social inequality**.
- This highlights the **universal moral principles** against exploiting others financially, making it relevant to all systems that aim for a fair and just economic structure.

## 6. Surah Ar-Rum (30:39)

> *"And whatever you give in riba to increase the wealth of people does not increase with Allah. But what you give in charity, seeking the pleasure of Allah, it is they who will get a manifold increase."*

### 6.Explanation

- This verse contrasts the benefits of **riba** with the benefits of **charity**. It emphasizes that money gained through interest-based transactions lacks true value, while wealth distributed for the sake of helping others yields **greater, lasting rewards**.
- The idea that **charity** has true **value**, both materially and spiritually, aligns with **global ethical frameworks** advocating for **wealth distribution**, **community support**, and **reducing poverty**.
- From a universal standpoint, the verse teaches that **helping others** through acts of kindness and charity brings about **greater social and individual benefits** than practices based on exploitation.

## Conclusion

The Quran provides a strong framework that emphasizes the importance of **ethical financial dealings** and **social justice**:

- Riba is seen as **exploitative**, leading to **economic instability**, **moral decay**, and **inequality**.
- While riba may appear to offer financial growth, it ultimately leads to negative consequences for individuals and society, while charity leads to **long-term prosperity** and **spiritual well-being**.
- The Quran advocates for systems of trade and finance that are based on **fairness**, **mutual benefit**, and **risk-sharing**. These principles align with broader **ethical and economic values**, which seek to reduce inequality and promote fairness in financial transactions.

These lessons have relevance beyond religious contexts, offering insights for building a more **ethical, inclusive, and compassionate** global economy.

## 2. The Negative Effects of Practicing Interest in Finance

### 2.1 Economic Instability

- Interest-based transactions can lead to **economic instability** by creating a financial system where the rich grow wealthier while the poor become more indebted. The focus on interest can drive inflation and economic bubbles, leading to eventual crises.

  - **Key takeaway**: The practice of interest disproportionately harms the **economically disadvantaged**, **reinforcing systemic inequality** and creating a **vicious cycle of poverty**.

### 2.3 Social and Moral Decay

### **Introduction**

Pi Network’s official listing is one of the most anticipated events in the crypto space. With its large user base and 6 years of mining, many investors and enthusiasts are wondering: **What will Pi’s price be on listing day?**

In this blog, I'll analyze pre-market trends, possible scenarios, and provide my prediction for Pi’s market behavior on launch day.

### **1️⃣ Pre-Market (IOU) Price Trends**

💰 Currently, **Pi is trading at ~$61** in pre-market IOU trading.  
⚠️ **Warning:** IOU prices are usually **inflated** due to speculation and low liquidity. Many previous tokens have shown vastly different prices after official trading begins.

### **2️⃣ Market Behavior on Listing Day**

📈 **Scenario 1 – Pump & Dump (Most Likely)**  

- Price surges to **$80-$100** due to early hype and speculative buying.  
- Early holders **sell off**, causing a crash to **$10-$30** within hours.

💡 **Scenario 2 – Stability & Strong Support (Less Likely)**  

- If Pi **controls supply** & gets **Binance/Coinbase listing**, it could stabilize around **$30-$50** with strong demand.

📉 **Scenario 3 – Market Shock & Collapse (Unlikely but Possible)**  

- If mass selling overwhelms demand, Pi could **drop to $5-$10** or even lower.

### **3️⃣ Real-Life Example of Similar Crypto Launches**

#### **🚀 Case 1: The Hype & Crash of ICP**  

Internet Computer (ICP) launched with huge anticipation, seeing a massive price surge shortly after its listing. However, the price plummeted dramatically within a few days, showing the risks of buying into new tokens during their early stages.
